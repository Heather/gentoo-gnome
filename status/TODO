Ebuild Notices:
===============
dev-util/gnome-devel-docs-2.26.2
#FIXME: Fixs the better as possible the fail install with emake jobs.
net-libs/libepc-0.3.10
 * 2 out of 16 tests fail, upstream bug #578792
x11-libs/gtk+-2.17.6
 * configure says >=xrandr-1.2.99 but remi tells me it's broken
media-gfx/eog-2.27.5
 * Fix compilation error, src/eog-properties-dialog.c:534 (the entire function)
   eog_properties_dialog_set_netbook_mode(), use private members which
   are conditionnally included (HAVE_METADATA), so when this macroconstant
   is undefined, this module can't compile.
   -> don't drop the function, the mostly part should be unactivated
   if HAVE_METADATA is undefined, but "netbook-mode" is a public property.
   Then report upstream.
